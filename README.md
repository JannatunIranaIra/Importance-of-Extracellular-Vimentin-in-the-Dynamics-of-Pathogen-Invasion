# Abstract
Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity
and function of the cell’s cytoskeleton. It is involved in essential cellular processes such as maintaining
cell shape, enabling cell migration, supporting cell division, promoting wound healing, and
facilitating tissue development. In addition to these intracellular functions, a growing body of research
highlights the significance of extracellular vimentin in various physiological and pathological
contexts. In the extracellular environment, vimentin can exist in multiple forms: either as a filamentous
or non-filamentous protein, attached to the cell surface, or present in a soluble exogenous state.
One particularly intriguing aspect of extracellular vimentin is its interaction with pathogens during
the invasion process. Studies have shown that vimentin can directly bind to viruses and bacteria, influencing
whether these pathogens are internalized by host cells. Interestingly, the effect of vimentin
varies depending on the pathogen: for example, in SARS-CoV infections, vimentin facilitates viral entry
by acting as a docking platformon the cellmembrane. In contrast, during human papillomavirus
(HPV) infections, it acts as a physical barrier, trapping the virus and slowing its entry into cells. In
this study, we investigate the role of extracellular vimentin in modulating pathogen invasion by developing
a mathematical model that incorporates five key components: the pathogen, vimentin, the
pathogen-vimentin complex, healthy epithelial cells, and infected epithelial cells. Through a combination
of analytical tools, such as asymptotic behavior analysis and transient dynamics, we explore
the effects of extracellular vimentin under various biological conditions. Our model enables a deeper
understanding of how extracellular vimentin may either support or inhibit infection, depending on
the nature of the invading pathogen.
